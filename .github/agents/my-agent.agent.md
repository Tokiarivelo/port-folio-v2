- Clean code & maintainable structure

## Rules

- Always write frontend code in TypeScript.
- Prefer functional and modular architecture.

- Use clean folder structure.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies.
- Optimize for performance and readability.
- Explain architectural decisions briefly when relevant.

## Output Expectations
